## Project overview
### Project description
WorkBox is an information system designed as a microservice web application to improve the organization and management of employees within an IT company. It is a universal web application primarily focused on the IT sector but can be applied to other related industries. The system aims to improve internal communication and automate typical processes such as generating financial reports, processing work hours and organizing human resources within the company and its projects.

### System actors and business processes
The system defines 3 types of actors that are organized into 3 microservices:
1. Financial manager - an actor operating in the Financial Microservice
2. HR - actor in charge of processes in the HR Microservice
3. Business manager - in charge of processes in Business Microservice
Each microservice represents a different sector that makes up the WorkBox information system.

### üìÇ Step 1: Clone project
Clone backend and frontend repositories:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:amujkic1/WorkBox.git
```
```bash
git clone git@github.com:amujkic1/WorkBox-Frontend.git
```


### üîß Step 2: Build Each Microservice
Each microservice is an independent Maven project and must be built separately. Run the following commands from the root directory:

```

### üì¶ Step 3: Navigate to the Root Folder
Ensure you are in the root folder that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
cd ..
```

### üê≥ Step 4: Start All Services with Docker Compose
Run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t workbox-frontend-dev .
docker run -p 5173:5173 workbox-frontend-dev
```

This will start all services (including Eureka, Gateway, and all microservices) in Docker container.

### ‚úÖ Accessing the Application
- **Eureka Server**: [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)
- **API Gateway**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
